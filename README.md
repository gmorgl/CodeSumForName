# CodingSumForName - Notes 03/21/2022

This was a coding challenge for an interview to get an internship at moebel.de.

I'm in the middle of a retraining as an IT specialist - application development, which has just started
in February 2022 and so far we have learned quite a bit about networking. Means my programming knowledge comes from internet and youtube.
So I asked my brother-in-law, who is already a developer, to help me with this job.

I had an idea how to solve this task, but he showed me a much faster and easier way. Especially the unit-tests...

Some people might say it's cheating, but for me it's solving problems as a team and talking to people
who are willing to help and have more knowledge than me. It is a very good way to learn and gather knowledge for tasks that need to be solved in the future.
